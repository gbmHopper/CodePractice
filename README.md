# CodePractice

This repo is to encourage myself to actively practice my software development skills. 

When working on this, I will add links and references to other people's resources that I have found helpful, as well as to hopefully explain why it is being implemented in a particular way. 

## Resources

- [Arlo's Commit Notation](https://github.com/RefactoringCombos/ArlosCommitNotation/) - a helpful set of documentation on a style of version control commit documentation that I would like to try in this repo.
